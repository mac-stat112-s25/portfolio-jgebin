## Review


**WHERE ARE WE?!? Starting a data project**

This final, short unit will help prepare us as we launch into course projects. In order to even *start* these projects, we need some sense of the following:

1.  data import: how to find data, store data, load data into RStudio, and do some preliminary data checks & cleaning

2.  exploratory data analysis (EDA)


## EDA

### What is EDA?! {-}

EDA is a preliminary, exploratory, and iterative analysis of our data relative to our general research questions of interest.

### Differece from Before {-}

How is this different than what we’ve been doing?  We've been focusing on various tools needed for various steps *within* an EDA. Now we'll bring them all together in a more cohesive *process*.



### Example {-}

In his book Exploratory Data Analysis with R, Dr. Roger D. Peng included an [EDA case study about Changes in Fine Particle Air Pollution in the U.S.](https://bookdown.org/rdpeng/exdata/data-analysis-case-study-changes-in-fine-particle-air-pollution-in-the-u-s-.html).  Note that the link to the datasets used by Peng in the chapter is currently broken.  Can you figure out the new location?^[It might have been moved to https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html]


### EDA Essentials {-}

-   Start small.\
    We often start with lots of data -- some of it useful, some of it not. To start:

    -   Focus on just a small set of variables of interest.
    -   Break down your research question into smaller pieces.
    -   Obtain the most simple numerical & visual summaries that are relevant to your research questions.

-   Ask questions.\
    We typically start a data analysis with at least some general research questions in mind. In obtaining numerical and graphical summaries that provide insight into these questions, we must ask:

    -   what questions *do* these summaries answer?
    -   what questions *don't* these summaries answer?
    -   what's surprising or interesting here?
    -   what *follow-up* questions do these summaries provoke?

-   Play! Be creative. Don't lock yourself into a rigid idea of what should happen.

-   Repeat.\
    Repeat this iterative questioning and analysis process as necessary, letting our reflections on the previous questions inspire our next steps.
